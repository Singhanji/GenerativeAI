    - Agenda:
        1. Define Generative AI
        2. Explain how generative AI works
        3. Describe Generative AI Model Types
        4. Describe Generative AI Applications

##  Define Generative AI
- Generative AI is a type of Artificial Intelligence technology that can produce various types of contents - including text, imagery, audio, and synthetic data.

## What s AI? And what is the difference between AI and ML?
- AI is a discipline like Physics is a discipline of Science.
- AI is a branch of Computer Science that deals with the creation of intelligent agents, and are systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously.
- Essentially, AI has to do with the theory and methods to build machines that think and act like humans.

## What is MAchine Learning?
- ML is a subfield of AI.
- It is a program or system that trains a model from input data.
- The trained model can make useful predictions from new (never-before-seen) data drawn from the same one used to train the model.
- Basically, it means that ML gives computer the ability to learn without explicit programming.

## How ML models looks like?
- Unsupervised ML model
- Supervised ML model

- Difference b/w these two is that Supervised ML model has lable.

- So, Labeled data is a data that comes with a tag, like a name, a type, or a number.
- Unlabeled data is a data that comes with no tags. 

## Supervised ML model
- Supervised learning implies the data is already labeled. In supervised learning we are learning from past examples to predict future values.

## Unsupervised ML model
- Unsupervised learning implies the data is not labeled. Unsupervised prblems are all about looking at the raw data, and seeing if it naturally falls into groups.

## Deep Learning is a subset of ML

## Deep learning
- Deep Learning is a type of ML that uses Artificial neural networks, allowing them to process more complex patterns that traditional machine learning.

- "Artificial neural networks" are inspred by human brain.
- neural networks can use both labeled and unlabeled data
- this is called semi-superised learning.
- In semi-superised learning, a neural n/w is trained on a small amount of labelled data and a large amount of unlabelled data.
- The labelled data helps the neural n/w to learn the basic cocepts of the task, while the unlabelled data helps the neural n/w to generalize to new examples.

#### Generative AI is a subset of Deep Learning.
- Meaning it uses Artificial neural n/ws can process both labelled and unlabelled data, using supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised methods.

## Large Language Models (LLM)
- LLMs are also a subset of deep learning
